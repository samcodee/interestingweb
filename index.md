# Markdown is amazing

I can do lot of wonders if I know how to use markdown and jekyll and css. 

At the same time Markdown abstracts and simplifies html.. Once I master in html then I can learn new technologies like markdown and save time in 
writing html tags. 

THe cool coder is someone who writes less code but acheive more.
